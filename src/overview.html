<h1>Documentation for GSMA SDK</h1>
<p>This SDK provides an all-in-one package of client library functions for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Operator API Discovery</strong> - allowing an application to determine the operator and available API services for the user<p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operator/API Logo</strong> - allowing an application to obtain 'official' image resources that can be used in the application user interface</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mobile Connect API Services</strong> - allowing an application to use authentication services linked with a mobile phone account</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Operator API Discovery</h2>
<p>Use the 'discovery' API to determine the operator and available API services for the mobile user. This API works with a network based discovery service 
together using various mechanisms to identify the operator.</p>
<p>Once this is done the application is notified of the available API services and associated 'meta data' for the operator.</p>
<p>See {@link com.gsma.android.oneapi.discovery.DiscoveryProvider} for details on the main interface for the discovery service</p>

<h2>Operator/API Logo</h2>
<p>Use the 'logo' API to obtain 'official' logos/ images relevant to the operator and API combination. This is related to the 
discovery API and in case the operator is known allows the application to see if operator specific logos are available.</p>
<p>The 'logo' API works with a network based logo store service and handles the retrieval of image resources as a convenience to the 
application.</p>
<p>See {@link com.gsma.android.oneapi.logo.LogoProvider} for details on the main interface for the discovery service</p>

<h2>Mobile Connect</h2>
<p>The Mobile Connect service is based on OAuth2/ OpenID Connect API services, but specialised for use with mobile networks providing
mobile authentication services. Applications can be sure that there is a real end user accessing the service, with access validated through the use of
the mobile device.</p>
<p>Mobile Connect provides a common API service across operators independent of the authentication methods preferred by the home network operator.</p>
<p>The Mobile Connect SDK provides a convenient interface allowing flexibility over the use of Mobile Connect and the OAuth2/ OpenID Connect API 
services on which it is based.</p>
<p>See the following main interfaces for Mobile Connect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>{@link com.gsma.android.mobileconnect.authorization.Authorization}</strong> - sign in to the application using the user's Mobile Connect account as a secure alternative to 
offering username/ password based registration or login. See {@link com.gsma.android.mobileconnect.authorization.Authorization} for the main interface 
for application authorization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>{@link com.gsma.android.mobileconnect.token.Token}</strong> - once the user is authorized the application receives a one time use code which is exchanged for a reusable
access token. See {@link com.gsma.android.mobileconnect.token.Token} for the main interface for exchanging an authorization code for a token.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>{@link com.gsma.android.mobileconnect.userinfo.Userinfo}</strong> - if supported by the Mobile Network and subject to user consent allows the application to receive 'user information' fields such as
email address, physical address etc using a previously obtained access token. See {@link com.gsma.android.mobileconnect.userinfo.Userinfo} for 
the main interface for obtaining 'user information' based on an access token. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Operation of this SDK is dependent on the following external libraries</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Google Android Support Library</strong> - version 4 (or later) which can be obtained from
	<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html">http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Jackson JSON library</strong> - version 1.9.3 which can be obtained from
	<a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson</a></p></li>
</ul>
